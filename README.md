-Select Exercise:
    1.(+) Addition

    4.(÷) Division

-Select Difficulty:

-Select Operands Count: (2–5)

Then it generates 10 tasks of the same arithmetic operation. For each task, it waits for input from the user and checks whether the answer is correct.

If correct, it prints Correct!
If not, it prints the task along with its correct answer.

At the end, it prints a mark represented as a percentage.

This program is useful for primary school students to practice arithmetic.
